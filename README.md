# springSite

Working on getting the hang of building backend systems with spring-boot.
I learnt a lot with this project. Mainly how to get started with springboot and VCS management with springboot.

This was just a starting project, testing the waters. I'm gonna put the rest of the springboot projects is a new repo [SpringBoot Projects]().
